# Motorway map of Europe using OSM big data in R

Have you ever wondered how to create your own road map? Look no further: in this tutorial, I'll show you how to make a motorway map of Europe using OSM big data and fewer than 100 lines of code in R ðŸ¤—! This tutorial opens the doors for you to map your own motorway network for any continent. You can tweak my code a bit and make a motorway map of a specific country from the list of countries available on the OSM GeoFabrik website.
